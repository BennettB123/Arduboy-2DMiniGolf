## How to play
- Hitting the ball
  - While in the game, use the left and right buttons to change your aim angle. When you're ready, press A to 'lock' in the angle. Power will begin fluctuating to determine how hard to hit the ball. At any point, press A again to hit the ball or press B to return to aim angle selection.
- Viewing the map
  - When selecting your aim, press the B button to enter "Map Viewer" mode. In this mode, you can use the Up/Down/Left/Right buttons to view the entire map. Press B again to return to aim angle selection.
- Pause Menu
  - At any point, hold B to enter the pause menu. Here, you can see the current hole number, par, and current stroke count. You can resume the game or exit to the main menu.

Finish all holes in as few strokes as possible!
